- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wimvhex - Wim Vancroonenburg, I work at Bricsys, a part of Hexagon.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science in general, and computer graphics, 3D geometry in specific. I'm also skilled in combinatorial optimization/operations research. I code in Java and C++, occasionally in C# and Python.
